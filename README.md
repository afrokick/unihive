Monetize your Unity3D app through mining at <a href="https://coinhive.com"><strong>CoinHive</strong></a> service. You can start or stop mining at any time in your gameplay. You can adjust threads count and  thread's sleep time. It is my home project and I decided to open source it. And my goal is to make it production ready for PCs, mobiles and web with simple api!


This plugin gives you a simple API:

1) Initialize it:

<code>UHive.UniHive.Initialize(...);</code>

2) Start it:

<code>UHive.UniHive.Start();</code>

3) Profit!
